# Module_20_Challenge

In this project, I created a Solidity smart contract that accepts two user addresses in order to automate the creation of joint savings accounts. Both addresses are able to control a joint savings account. The smart contract uses ether management functions to implement a financial institutionâ€™s requirements for providing the features of the joint savings account. These features will consist of the ability to deposit and withdraw funds from the account.
